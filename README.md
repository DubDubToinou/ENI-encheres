<h1 align="center">Ench√®res (Auction)</h1>

This eBay-like web app lets users sell second-hand objects at auction.

## Goal
The goal of this project was to develop a fully functioning auction web app, the following instructions were given :
- Users should be able to create, edit and delete an account.
- The page displaying the auctions should be different whether the user is logged in or not, with more filters and search options for logged-in users.
- Users can create an auction, place bids, and win at an auction.
- Users can search for another user profile.

### Extra credit

- The app is responsive and was developed with a mobile-first approach.
- A seller can modify an item.
- Administrators can edit, add or delete an item category.
- Users can "buy" credits.
